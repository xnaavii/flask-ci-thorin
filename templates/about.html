<h2>About Page</h2>
<p>The formation of the group grew out of a meeting Gandalf had with Thorin in Bree which kindled Thorin's interest in
    recapturing his long lost family inheritance. (Thorin's grandfather had been the King under the Mountain when Smaug
    came and took it.) Remembering that he had once known an adventurous Hobbit on his travels in the Shire, Gandalf
    decided to add Bilbo to their company because he knew that stealth and cunning were preferable to force. Gandalf
    also believed that someone like Bilbo could keep the sometimes prideful and stubborn Dwarves from rash action. The
    superstitious Dwarves also considered thirteen to be an unlucky number, and as Gandalf had planned to leave on other
    business, welcomed a fourteenth to fill into their party.</p>

        <h3>Thorin Oakenshield</h3>
        <p>Thorin II was born in TA 2746 to the Dwarf prince Thráin II in the city of the Lonely Mountain. Early in his
            youth, Thorin and the other Dwarves of the Lonely Mountain were forced to flee by the dragon Smaug, in TA
            2770. While in exile, he quickly grew into a capable warrior. This was demonstrated at the Battle of
            Azanulbizar, near Moria, in TA 2799. He fought with one of the Dwarven armies beneath Moria's East-gate, and
            at some point in the battle, his shield broke, and, using an oaken tree branch found on the ground as a
            shield, he gained the epithet "Oakenshield," which remained with him even in death.</p>

            company on the quest to reclaim the Lonely Mountain, wearing a brown hood.Óin was one of the Dwarves who
            bet that Bilbo would come along with them to reclaim the Lonely Mountain. Óin and his brother Glóin were
